# Hashid Rails

This gem allows you to easily use [Hashids](http://hashids.org/ruby/) in your Rails app. Instead of your models using sequential numbers like 1, 2, 3, they will instead have unique short hashes like "yLA6m0oM", "5bAyD0LO", and "wz3MZ49l". The database will still use integers under the hood, so this gem can be added or removed at any time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hashid-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hashid-rails

## Usage

Model classes must opt-in to hashids by including the mixin module:

```
class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hashid::Rails
  ...
end
```

Just use `Model#find` passing in the hashid instead of the model id:

```ruby
@person = Person.find(params[:hashid])
```

## Configuration

To customize the Hashids seed and ensure that another user of the gem cannot easily reverse engineer your ids, 
create an initializer and:

```ruby
Hashid::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.secret = 'my secret'
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
